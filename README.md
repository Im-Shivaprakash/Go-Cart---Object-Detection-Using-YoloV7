# Go-Cart - Object Detection Using YOLOv7

## Overview

The "Go-Cart" project aims to develop an automated shopping trolley prototype capable of object detection using the YOLOv7 algorithm. The system utilizes a camera mounted on the shopping trolley to detect objects or products placed within it. The YOLOv7 algorithm is employed for real-time object detection, enabling the system to identify various items as they are added to the trolley.

## Prototype

The project provides a prototype of the automated shopping trolley system, implemented in a Jupyter notebook environment. The prototype demonstrates the object detection capability using YOLOv7, allowing users to see real-time detection results and inference on test images.
